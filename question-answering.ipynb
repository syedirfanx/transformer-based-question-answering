    "# Transformer Based Question Answering\n",
    "One of the popular applications of Natural Language Processing (NLP) is Question Answering. In this work I have used Transformer library to build a QA system. Transformers is an open-source library developed by Hugging Face that provides a wide range of pre-trained models such as BERT, DistilBERT for QA. \n",
